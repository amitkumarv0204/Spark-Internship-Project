# Spark-Internship-Project
The project is "Percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours". where I have analyzed the performance of a student given how many hours he devoted to his/her study, I have used pandas and NumPy libraries to visualize the data and then I have used machine learning to predict the performance of student.
